# SinglyLinkedList
Singly Linked List Data Structure
//Program is a demonstration of the Singly Linked List data structure. Prompts user to either enter or remove a number 
//from the list they create. The singly linked list allows elements to be added or removed by position; the 
//beginning, end or somewhere in the middle. The singly linked list is created using a struct for the class,
//pointers and dynamically allocated memory through built in pointers. If I wanted to take this project
//a step further I could use smart pointers. The program also allows the user to print the current list.
